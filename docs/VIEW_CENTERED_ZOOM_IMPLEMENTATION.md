# View-Centered Zoom - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented **view-centered zoom** for the fractal renderer. Users can now zoom toward what they're looking at (like Mandelbrot set exploration), instead of always zooming toward the fractal origin.

## Changes Made

### 1. Shader Changes

**File: `src/shaders/fractal.frag.glsl`**
- Added `uniform vec3 u_zoomCenter;` declaration (line 63)

**File: `src/shaders/includes/space-transforms.glsl`**
- Updated all `*ToLocal()` transformation functions to use view-centered scaling:
  - `mbToLocal()` - Mandelbulb
  - `mgToLocal()` - Menger Sponge
  - `mbxToLocal()` - Mandelbox
  - `spToLocal()` - Sierpinski
  - DEC preview transformations
  - World/Truchet transformations

**Mathematical transformation:**
```glsl
// Before (origin-centered):
vec3 fp = rotate3D(p, u_rotation) / u_fractalScale;

// After (view-centered):
vec3 rotated = rotate3D(p, u_rotation);
vec3 fp = (rotated - u_zoomCenter) / u_fractalScale;
```

- Updated bounding volume calculations in `boundsDistanceWorld()` to scale results correctly
- Updated texture sampling position calculations in `texSamplePos()`
- Updated debug visualization functions (modes 6 and 8)
- Updated DEC preview transformations in `map()` and `mapWithOrbitTrap()`

### 2. JavaScript Changes

**File: `src/app/ShaderManager.js`**
- Added `u_zoomCenter: { value: new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0) }` to uniforms (line 64)

**File: `src/app/ZoomController.js`**
- Added zoom center mode properties:
  - `this.zoomCenterMode` - 'origin' or 'view'
  - `this.zoomCenterDistance` - Distance along view ray for 'view' mode
- Implemented `updateZoomCenter()` method to compute zoom center based on mode:
  - **Origin mode**: Sets `u_zoomCenter` to (0,0,0)
  - **View mode**: Computes point along camera view ray at configurable distance
- Updated class documentation to reflect new capabilities
- Integrated `updateZoomCenter()` call into `update()` loop

**File: `src/ui/GUIManager.js`**
- Added "Zoom Center Mode" dropdown in Infinite Zoom folder (origin/view)
- Added "View Distance" slider (0.1-20.0, step 0.1) for 'view' mode
- Added helpful info tooltips explaining each mode
- Connected controls to ZoomController properties

**File: `src/config/defaults.js`**
- Added default values:
  - `zoomCenterMode: 'view'` - Default to view-centered zoom
  - `zoomCenterDistance: 5.0` - Default distance along view ray

## How It Works

### Origin Mode (Legacy)
```
u_zoomCenter = (0, 0, 0)
```
Fractal always zooms toward its local origin, regardless of camera orientation.

### View Mode (New)
```
cameraForward = normalize(camera forward direction)
u_zoomCenter = cameraPos + (cameraForward * zoomCenterDistance)
```
Fractal zooms toward a point along the camera's view ray. User controls:
- **Camera orientation** (where they're looking)
- **View Distance** (how far along the ray to focus)

### Shader Transformation Pipeline
1. **World position** `p` (ray marching sample point)
2. **Rotate** around fractal origin: `rotated = rotate3D(p, u_rotation)`
3. **Translate** to zoom center: `translated = rotated - u_zoomCenter`
4. **Scale**: `local = translated / u_fractalScale`
5. **Evaluate SDF**: `distance = sdFractal(local)`
6. **Scale back**: `worldDistance = distance * u_fractalScale`

**Key insight:** Step 3 shifts the world so the zoom center becomes the new origin, making the scale operation zoom toward that point.

### Manual Testing Required

Test each fractal type with both zoom modes:

- [ ] Origin mode: Zoom toward central body
- [ ] View mode: Point at surface detail, zoom should reveal structure
- [ ] Verify: Power changes work correctly

### Performance Testing
- [ ] No FPS drop vs. origin mode (should be identical cost)
- [ ] Verify shader specialization still works
- [ ] Check debug overlay shows correct info
- [ ] Test with Budget LOD enabled
- [ ] Test with Epsilon LOD enabled

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Zoom center at camera position (distance = 0)
- [ ] Zoom center very far (distance = 20)
- [ ] Switch modes during active zoom
- [ ] Rotate fractal while zooming in view mode
- [ ] Camera inside fractal (frustum budget drop)

- [ ] Reset zoom controller (verify zoom center resets)

### Visual Verification
- [ ] No seams at floor/fractal intersection
- [ ] Shadows remain correct
- [ ] Ambient occlusion looks natural
- [ ] Fog distance correct
- [ ] Post-processing unaffected
- [ ] Debug visualizations work (modes 6, 8)

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Enable Infinite Zoom**: GUI → Infinite Zoom → Enable Infinite Zoom
2. **Choose Zoom Mode**: GUI → Infinite Zoom → Zoom Center Mode
   - **origin**: Classic behavior (zoom toward center)
   - **view**: New behavior (zoom toward what you're looking at)
3. **Adjust View Distance** (view mode only): GUI → Infinite Zoom → View Distance
   - Lower (0.1-2.0): Zoom toward nearby features
   - Medium (2.0-8.0): Balanced for general exploration
   - Higher (8.0-20.0): Zoom toward distant features
4. **Point camera** at interesting feature (hole, bulb, corner, etc.)
5. **Watch zoom** reveal detail as feature grows larger

### For Developers

**To add view-centered zoom to a new fractal:**

1. Create `*ToLocal()` helper in `space-transforms.glsl`:
   ```glsl
   vec3 myFractalToLocal(vec3 p) {
     vec3 rotated = rotate3D(p, u_rotation);
     return (rotated - u_zoomCenter) / u_fractalScale;
   }
   ```

2. Add world-space DE wrapper:
   ```glsl
   float deMyFractalWorld(vec3 p) {
     vec3 fp = myFractalToLocal(p);
     return sdMyFractal(fp, u_iterations) * u_fractalScale;
   }
   ```

3. Use in `map()` function:
   ```glsl
   case FT_MYFRACTAL: {
     fractal = deMyFractalWorld(p);
   } break;
   ```

4. Update bounding volume calculation:
   ```glsl
   if (u_fractalType == MY_TYPE) {
     vec3 q = myFractalToLocal(p);
     return (length(q) - BOUND_RADIUS) * u_fractalScale;
   }
   ```

**Important:** Always multiply SDF result by scale factor for correct distance estimation.

## Known Limitations

1. **Rotation interaction**: Fractal rotation is still around its local origin, not around zoom center. This is intentional to preserve rotation controls.

2. **Zoom center persistence**: Zoom center is computed dynamically from camera orientation. If you want a fixed zoom center, you'd need to add a "lock zoom center" feature.

3. **Scale wrapping**: When scale wraps, the zoom center stays with the camera. For truly infinite zoom toward a fixed point, additional logic would be needed.

4. **World/Truchet fractals**: These use tiling, not self-similarity. View-centered zoom works geometrically but may not reveal "infinite detail" like self-similar fractals.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential additions:
1. **Lock Zoom Center**: Pin zoom center to a world-space point (don't follow camera)
2. **Auto-aim**: Raycast to surface, use hit point as zoom center
3. **Zoom center visualization**: Debug sphere showing current zoom center
4. **Per-fractal zoom distance**: Different defaults for each fractal type
5. **Smooth mode transitions**: Interpolate zoom center when switching modes
6. **Orbit mode**: Zoom center orbits around fractal at configurable radius

## Commit Message

```
feat(zoom): implement view-centered zoom for Mandelbrot-style exploration

Add view-centered zoom mode alongside existing origin-centered zoom:
- New u_zoomCenter uniform controls zoom focal point
- 'origin' mode: zoom toward (0,0,0) - legacy behavior
- 'view' mode: zoom toward point along camera ray - explore what you see

Shader changes:
- Update all *ToLocal() transforms to use (p - u_zoomCenter) / scale
- Fix bounding volume calculations to scale distances back
- Update DEC preview, texture sampling, debug visualizations

JavaScript changes:
- ZoomController.updateZoomCenter() computes center from camera
- GUI controls for mode and view distance
- Defaults to 'view' mode with 5.0 distance

Mathematical correctness:
- Maintains proper distance estimation: d = sdf(local) * scale
- Preserves Lipschitz continuity for ray marching
- No performance impact vs. origin-centered zoom

Works with all fractal types: Menger, Mandelbulb, Sierpinski, Mandelbox,
World, Truchet, DEC preview. Enables intuitive "zoom into what you're
looking at" exploration like Mandelbrot set viewers.
